# Frontend

This is the *official* frontend. Feel free to hack, slash, read, and modify our code for yourself or others. The client/server protocols will be fully documented to make this as smooth as possible for those who wish to do so.

This is simply the official, default client that will be hosted on the pixel.horse website, and will be ground zero for all new client features. Official support will be provided for **this client and this client only** - if you have any issues with an unofficial client, take it up with that client's maintainer. Questions, issues, or concerns about the protocol and official client itself can be submitted as an issue (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)) or discussed in our Discord.
